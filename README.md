# spring-boot-microservice-level-1
In this project we demonstrate microservice architecture. we create three apps that are independent however have to work together to form an ecosystem, each app acts as a service, and provide data to other services when requested. The services are all developed in Spring Boot for demonstration purposes, although later other services done in django and laravel will be added. #Spring-Boot #Java #Microservices
